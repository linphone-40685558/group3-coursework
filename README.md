# **üöÄ Population Information Reporting System**

## **üìñ Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing a **Population Information Reporting System** that provides various reports based on
population data from an SQL database. The system will allow the organization to generate reports on population data at
different levels, including by country, continent, and region.

Key features include:

- **Population Reports**: Generate reports from an SQL database on various population statistics.
- **Top N Reports**: Retrieve the top N populated countries or cities globally, by continent, or by region, as defined
  by the user.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI pipelines for testing and building with Maven and Docker.
